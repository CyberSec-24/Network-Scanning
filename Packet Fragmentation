Packet fragmentation refers to the splitting of a probe packet into several smaller packets (fragments) while sending it to a network.
This process of scanning was developed to avoid false positives generated by other scans because of a packet filtering device on the target system. 
The TCP header splits into several packets to evade the packet filte
 The initialized flags in the next packet allow the remote host to reassemble the packets upon receipt via an Internet protocol module that detects 
the fragmented data packets using field-equivalent values of the source, destination, protocol, and identification

However, IP reassembly on the server side may result in unpredictable and abnormal results, such as fragmentation of the IP header data.
Some hosts may fail to parse and reassemble the fragmented packets, which may lead to crashes, reboots, or even network device monitoring dumps
. Since many IDS use signature-based methods to indicate scanning attempts on IP and/or TCP headers, the use of fragmentation will often evade this type of packet filtering and detection, 
resulting in a high probability of causing problems on the target network.
