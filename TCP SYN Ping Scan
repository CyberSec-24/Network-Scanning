In this type of host discovery technique, an attacker uses the Nmap tool to initiate the three-way handshake by sending the empty TCP SYN flag to the target host. 

After receiving SYN, the target host acknowledges the receipt with an ACK flag. 
After reception of the ACK flag, the attacker confirms that the target host is active and terminates the connection by sending an RST flag to the target host machine 

 Port 80 is used as the default destination port. A range of ports can also be specified in this type of pinging format without inserting a space between -PS and the port number 

In Zenmap, the -PS option is used to perform a TCP SYN ping scan.

Syntax:- Nmap -PN <ip address>
Cpmmand:- nmap -sn -PM 192.168.187.208
