TCP ACK ping also uses the default port 80. 
In the TCP ACK ping technique, the attackers send an empty TCP ACK packet to the target host directly

the target host responds with an RST flag to terminate the request. 
The reception of this RST packet at the attackerâ€™s end indicates that the host is active.

n Zenmap, the -PA option is used to perform a TCP ACK ping scan.

Syntax:- nmap -PA <ip address>
Command:- nmap -PA 192.168.187.208
