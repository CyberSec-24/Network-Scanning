In a list scan, the discovery of the active network host is indirect. ​

A list scan simply generates and prints a list of IPs/Names without actually pinging or scanning the hosts​

As a result, the list scan shows all IP addresses as “not scanned” (0 hosts up)​

Zenmap, the -sL option is used to perform a list scan​

Syntax:- nmap –sL –v <ip address>​

Command:-nmap -sL -v 192.168.187.208​
