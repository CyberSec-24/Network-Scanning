In TCP Connect scanning, the OSâ€™s TCP connect() system call tries to open a connection to every port of interest on the target machine
 If the port is listening, the connect() call will result in a successful connection with the host on that particular port; otherwise,
it will return an error message stating that the port is not reachable

In the TCP three-way handshake, the client sends a SYN packet, which the recipient acknowledges with a SYN+ACK packet. 
Then, the client acknowledges the SYN+ACK packet with an ACK packet to complete the connection

Making a separate connect() call for every targeted port in a linear manner would take a long time over a slow connection.
In Zenmap, the -sT option is used to perform TCP Connect/full open scan.

syntax:- nmap -sT -v <ip address>
command:- nmap -sT -v 192.128.187.208
