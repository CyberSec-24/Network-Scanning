The traditional ICMP ECHO ping, where the attackers send an ICMP address mask query to the target host to acquire information related to the subnet mask

This type of ping method is also effective in identifying the active hosts similarly to the ICMP timestamp ping,
specifically when the administrator blocks the traditional ICMP Echo ping.

In Zenmap, the -PM option is used to perform an ICMP address mask ping scan.

Syntax:- nmap -PM <ip address>
Command:- nmap -sn -PM 192.168.187.208
