SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan is a more advanced type of scan. In this type of scan, attackers send the COOKIE ECHO chunk to the target, and if the target port is open,
it will silently drop the packets onto the port and you will not receive any response from the target
The COOKIE ECHO chunk is not blocked by non-stateful firewall rule sets as in the INIT scan.
Only an advanced IDS can detect the SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan. In Zenmap, the -sZ option is used to perform the SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan.

Syntax:- nmap -sZ -v <ip address>
Command:- nmap -sZ -v 10.10.1.11
