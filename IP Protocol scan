IP protocol ping is the latest host discovery option that sends IP ping packets with the IP header of any specified protocol number.
It has the same format as the TCP and UDP ping
 This technique tries to send different packets using different IP protocols, hoping to get a response indicating that a host is online.

In a nutshell, attackers send different probe packets of different IP protocols to the target host; any response from any probe indicates that a host is online
