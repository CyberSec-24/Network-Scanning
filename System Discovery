Every port is assigned a specific service, and every service has its own version. Some versions of the protocols are insecure, and they can allow attackers to compromise the machine by exploiting this vulnerability.​

By obtaining accurate service version numbers, an attacker can determine which exploits the target system is vulnerable to​

The probes from the Nmap service-probes database are used for querying various services and matching expressions for recognizing and parsing responses.​

Zenmap, the -sV option is used to detect service versions​

Syntax:- nmap –sV <ip address>​

Command:-nmap -sV  192.168.187.208​
