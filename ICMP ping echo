-> Attackers use the ICMP ping scan to send ICMP packets to the destination system to gather all necessary information about it. 

-> This is because ICMP does not include port abstraction, and it is different from port scanning.

-> ICMP ECHO ping scan involves sending ICMP ECHO requests to a host. If the host is alive, it will return an ICMP ECHO reply.

-> This scan is useful for locating active devices or determining if ICMP is passing through a firewall

-> This technique does not work on Windows-based networks, as their TCP/IP stack implementation does not reply to ICMP probes directed at the broadcast address
