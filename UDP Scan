-> When you send a packet to a closed UDP port, most of the hosts send an ICMP_PORT_UNREACH error.

-> Thus, you can determine whether a port is open if UDP packets or ICMP errors are not guaranteed to arrive. 

-> Thus, UDP scanners of this type must implement retransmission of packets that appear lost.

->A remote host will require access to the raw ICMP socket to distinguish closed ports from unreachable ports

-> Syntax:- nmap -sU -v <Ip address>
-> Example:- nmap -sU -v 10.10.1.10
