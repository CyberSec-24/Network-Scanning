-> Source port manipulation is a technique used for bypassing the IDS/firewall

->  the actual port numbers are manipulated with common port numbers for evading certain IDS and firewall rules.

-> The administrator mostly configures the firewall by allowing the incoming traffic from well-known ports such as HTTP, DNS, FTP, etc. 

-> The firewall can simply allow the incoming traffic from the packets sent by the attackers using such common ports.

-> The firewalls can be made secure using application-level proxies or protocol-parsing firewall elements, this technique helps the attacker to bypass the firewall rules easily.

->  The attacker tries to manipulate the original port number with the common port numbers, which can easily bypass the IDS/firewall.

-> Syntax:- nmap -g <port number> <Ip Address>
-> Example:- nmap -g 80 10.10.1.11
