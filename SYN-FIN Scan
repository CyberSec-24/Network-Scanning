-> This process of scanning was developed to avoid false positives generated by other scans because of a packet filtering device on the target system

->  The TCP header splits into several packets to evade the packet filter

-> For any transmission, every TCP header must have the source and destination port for the initial packet (8-octet, 64-bit)

-> The initialized flags in the next packet allow the remote host to reassemble the packets upon receipt via an Internet protocol module

-> that detects the fragmented data packets using field-equivalent values of the source, destination, protocol, and identification

-> IP reassembly on the server side may result in unpredictable and abnormal results, such as fragmentation of the IP header data. 

-> Some hosts may fail to parse and reassemble the fragmented packets, which may lead to crashes, reboots, or even network device monitoring dump

-> Since many IDS use signature-based methods to indicate scanning attempts on IP and/or TCP headers, the use of fragmentation will often evade this type of packet filtering and detection, resulting in a high probability of causing problems on the target network

->  Attackers use the SYN/FIN scanning method with IP fragmentation to evade this type of filtering and detection.

-> Syntax:- nmap -sS -T4 -A -f- v <Ip Address>
-> Example nmap -sS -T4 -A -f- v 10.10.1.11
