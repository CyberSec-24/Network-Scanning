-> SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan is a more advanced type of scan. In this type of scan, attackers send the COOKIE ECHO chunk to the target 

-> if the target port is open, it will silently drop the packets onto the port and you will not receive any response from the target.

-> If the target sends back the ABORT chunk response, then the port is considered as a closed port. 

-> The COOKIE ECHO chunk is not blocked by non-stateful firewall rule sets as in the INIT scan

->  Only an advanced IDS can detect the SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan

-> Syntax:- nmap -sZ -v <Ip address>
-> Example:- nmap -sZ -v 10.10.1.11
