Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) is a reliable message-oriented transport layer protocol
Some SCTP applications include discovering VoIP, IP telephony, and Signaling System 7/SIGnaling TRANsport (SS7/SIGTRAN)-related services. 
SCTP association comprises a four-way handshake method,
The SCTP INIT scan is very similar to the TCP SYN scan; comparatively,
it is also stealthy and unobtrusive, as it cannot complete SCTP associations, hence making the connection half-open
Attackers send INIT chunk to the target host. If the port is listening or open, it sends an acknowledgement as an INIT+ACK chunk.
The port is also indicated as a filtered port if the target server responds with an ICMP unreachable exception
