Attackers send UDP packets to the target host, and a UDP response means that the target host is active. 
If the target host is offline or unreachable, various error messages such as host/network unreachable or TTL exceeded could be returned.

In Zenmap, the -PU option is used to perform the UDP ping scan
 The default port number used by Nmap for the UDP ping scan is 40,125. This highly uncommon port is used as the default for sending UDP packets to the target

Syntax:- nmap -PU <ip address>
