The stealth scan involves resetting the TCP connection between the client and the server abruptly before completion of the three-way handshake signals, hence making the connection half-open​

The half-open scan partially opens a connection but stops halfway through. The stealth scan is also called a “SYN scan,” because it only sends the SYN packet​

In the last stage, it examines the packets entering the interface and terminates the connection before triggering a new initialization to identify remote ports​

The client sends a single SYN packet to the server on the appropriate port. If the port is open, the server subsequently responds with a SYN/ACK packet​

In Zenmap, the -sS option is used to perform a stealth scan/TCP half-open scan​

Syntax:- nmap -sS -v <ip address>
Command:-nmap -sS -v 192.128.187.208
