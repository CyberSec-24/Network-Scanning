This scan technique is very similar to NULL, FIN, and Xmas scan, but the probe used here is FIN/ACK.​

In most cases, to determine if the port is open or closed, the RST packet should be generated as a response to a probe request​

The port is closed if the probe gets a response as an RST packet​

The port is filtered when the ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is returned from the target host. ​

In Zenmap, the -sM option is used to perform the TCP Maimon scan​

Command:-nmap -sM -v 192.128.187.208​
