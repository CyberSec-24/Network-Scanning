-> Xmas scan is a type of inverse TCP scanning technique with the FIN, URG, and PUSH flags set to send a TCP frame to a remote device.

->  If the target has opened the port, then you will receive no response from the remote system.

-> If the target has closed the port, then you will receive a remote system reply with an RST. 

-> You can use this port scanning technique to scan large networks and find which host is up and what services it is offering. 

-> the flags are often set in the nonsense pattern URG-PSH-FIN. Attackers use the TCP Xmas scan to determine if ports are closed on the target machine via the RST packet.

-> Syntax:- nmap -sX -v <ip address>
-> Example nmap -sX -v 10.10.1.11
