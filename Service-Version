->  Service version detection helps attackers to obtain information about running services and their versions on a target system

-> Obtaining an accurate service version number allows attackers to determine the vulnerability of target system to particular exploits

-> Every port is assigned a specific service, and every service has its own version. Some versions of the protocols are insecure, that can allow attackers to compromise the machine by exploiting this vulnerability

-> Service version detection helps attackers to obtain information about the running services and their versions on a target system.

-> Syntax:- nmap -sV <Ip address>
-> Example:-  nmap -sV  10.10.1.11
